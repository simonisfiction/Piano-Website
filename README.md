# Piano-Website
An interactive piano website. You are able to play a virtual piano with 
your computer's keyboard. currently, the piano sounds like a classical 
guitar, because in the past I recorded notes for a c++/sfml version of this
project. I would like to expand the sound library and allow users to pick 
what kind of sound they would like to use.

in the future, I would like to allow people to upload their own samples, 
and record themselves with a metronome. I am very new to web development,
so i am probably doing things in a relatively archaic way. I am very open 
to suggestions and input!
 
the layout is currently as follows: (capital letters represent sharp notes)
 2 3  5 6 7            C D  F G A  
q w er t y u   ---->  c d ef g a b  

  s d  g h j           C D  F G A
 z x cv b n m  ---->  c d ef g a b

I will be switching the layout to this soon:
 2 3 4  6 7  9 0             F G A  C D  F G
q w e rt y ui o p   ---->   f g a bc d ef g a 

  s d  g h j  l ;             C D  F G A  C D
 z x cv b n m, . /  ---->    c d ef g a bc d e
